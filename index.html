          <h2>ADVENTUROUS</h2>
          <p class="indpara">Adventure travel pushes you outside of your comfort zone. It puts you in unfamiliar situations and challenges you to test your mettle. In the last millenia, the typical adventure traveler was a young gap year kid bungee jumping off cliff. In those days, adventure travel often meant risky. Not anymore. Today’s adventure traveller is often over fifty, super busy with a high stress job, has more disposable income, and when vacationing, instead of seeking risk, instead seeks meaningful and life changing experiences, and finds that adventure travel delivers.</p>
